### Jellies

Beginner tip: don't fight a jelly next to a burst bloodwort. That is very bad.

Hit the jelly jackpot by reading a scroll of summon monsters when surrounded by empowered jelly allies. Good luck.

Jellymancing: Be wary of the food clock. Try to resist returning to previous levels to heal your allies. Be mindful that they will all die at some point, so it's futile to get too invested.

### Others

Salamanders made terrible pets.

## Staves

### Staff of Tunnelling

Liberate a few rats from a wall trap before the paralysing gas is released.

Clear some space around edges of flammable terrain in confined rooms.

Creatively combine with a staff of obstruction.

### Lightning

Staves of Lightning emit a bright glow from each bolt. This means you can use them as 'flares' to briefly illuminate the depths of the deeper dungeon.

## Gas

#### Gas separation in desperation

Gases don't mix, so gases of paralysis and confusion can create a pocket of relative safety if you're trapped by caustic gas.

## Weapons

If you find yourself confused when surrounded by monsters, switch to a flail or axe to increase your chance of striking them.
