### Jellies

Beginner tip: don't fight a jelly next to a burst bloodwort. That is very bad.

Hit the jelly jackpot by reading a scroll of summon monsters when surrounded by empowered jelly allies. Good luck.

Jellymancing: Be wary of the food clock. Try to resist endlessly returning to a bloodwort to heal your allies. Be mindful that they will all die at some point, so it's futile to get too invested.

### Others

Salamanders made terrible pets.

## Staves

### Staff of Tunnelling

Liberate a few rats from a wall trap to it safer after paralysing gas is released.

Clear some space around edges of flammable terrain in confined rooms.

Combine with a staff of obstruction for a creative combo.

### Lightning

Staves of Lightning emit a bright glow from each bolt. This means you can use them as 'flares' to briefly illuminate the depths of the deeper dungeon.
